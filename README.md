Investigating algorithms and data structures with the AgileVentures community.

[Agile Ventures](https://www.agileventures.org/) is an official UK Charity (#1170963) dedicated to crowdsourced learning and project development. We follow the Agile approach to software development (see below), and do so online everyday using remote pair programming technologies such as Google Hangouts.

Anyone at any skill level can participate or simply observe in the remote pair programming sessions and planning meetings as we develop solutions for real customers in the non-profit sector. There are no minimum requirements, simply an interest to learn.

We hold scrum meetings and pair programming sessions every day with participants from all time zones and on all levels.

This repo contains some of the algorithms and data structures we've been exploring.

Once a week we come together from all around the globe to learn about Data Structures and Algorithms. The following is an incomplete list of participants who join in via virtual hangout and colloborate through live coding sessions on cloud9.
